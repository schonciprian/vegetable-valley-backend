# Vegetable Valley

This is the backend for Vegetable Valley application using Laravel. It is now used for authentication.

My name is Ciprian and I love spending time in the garden while I am listening to the chirping of birds or the noise of the wind. 
I started gardening back in my childhood during summer breaks in my grandparents' garden with my own small plot. 
During the 2020's quarantine I have started to plant some vegetables in a small garden. 

In the project you can find some description about vegetables on how to plant or how to take care of them. 
To plan your tasks you can check for the weather forecast too.

## Requirements

PHP (7.4 recommended) with Laravel 8, Composer.

## Setup the application

Create your own database for the project.

See env.example file for details, and create your own .env file for database connection!

Create migrations with
```bash
 php artisan migrate
```

In the project directory, run:

```bash
  composer install
```

## How to start the application

```bash
  php artisan serve
```

Open the url to check whether the server is running or not.
